		(a)Show that the \itr{variation}{变化} of pressure in the \itr{radial direction}{径向} is given by $\dfrac{\dif p}{\dif r}=\rho \omega^2 r$.
		
		(b)Take $p=p_c$ at the axis of rotation ($r=0$) and show that the pressure $p$ at any point $r$ is
		\begin{center}
			$p=p_c+\dfrac{1}{2}\rho\omega^2 r^2$
		\end{center}

		(c)Show that the liquid surface is of \itr{paraboloidal}{抛物面的} form(Figure 4-1); that is, a vertical cross section of the surface is the curve $y=\dfrac{\omega^2 r^2}{2g}$

	\begin{example}[流体动力学---\refleaftext{solution4.2}]
		As shown in Figure 4-2, it is an \itr{air suction device}{空吸装置}. Given that the depth of the centerline of the \itr{catheter}{导管} below the liquid level in container $A$ is $h$, 
		the height difference between the liquid level in container $B$ and the centerline of the horizontal catheter is $h_b$, \itr{the cross-sectional area}{横截面积} at the \itr{nozzle}{喷嘴} $d$ is $S_d$, 
		and the cross-sectional area at the \itr{contraction section}{收缩段} $c$ is $S_c$. What are the conditions for the \itr{ratio}{比率} of $S_d$ to $S_c$ to occur for \itr{suction}{抽吸}?
